# Calculator

This is just a random Calculator program I made all in C++ for the purpose of putting my new knowledge to good use. Below is how to run the program.

## Compiling this program

To compile this program, you need a compiler like gcc or clang. This has been untested with the Windows C++ compiler. You also need to install CMake, which the program uses to generate the build files.
Clone this GitHub repo, go into the folder for the GitHub repo, and type in ``mkdir build && cd build``. You can then run ``cmake ..``to configure and generate the build files, then run ``make`` to compile the actual program.
Once it is done, you can now run ``./Calculator`` and it should work! Enjoy!
