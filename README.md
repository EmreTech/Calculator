# Calculator

This is just a random Calculator program I made all in C++ for the purpose of putting my new knowledge to good use. Below is how to run the program.

## Compiling this program

To compile this program, you should use g++ or clang++. I am not sure if the Windows C++ compiler will work or not, so feel free to try it.
You first need to clone this GitHub repo to any folder you want. Then I compiled and ran the program with 
``` clang++ -o a.out main.cpp calculator.cpp -std=c++17 && ./a.out```
and it should launch the program. If you get an error like ``command clang++ not found`` then you have to install build-essentials for Linux, or for macOS the Command Line Utils from XCode.
